    <h4>When the world was still to be born
        When Adam was still to receive his form
        Then my relationship began
        When I heard the Lord’s voice
        A voice sweet and clear
        I said “YES” with my heart
        And formed a bond with land
        I love
        When all of us were one, My bond
        then begun.</h4>
